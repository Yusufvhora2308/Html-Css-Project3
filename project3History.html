            <p class="para4">Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide
                Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single
                static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network
                services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web
                engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web
                server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
                are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user
                browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, the
                industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
